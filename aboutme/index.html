    <h2></h2>
    <p>Hi all. My name is Luca Gaviraghi, and no nickname.</p>
    <p>I am from Milan, Italy. I'm married and have 3 kids, ranging from 12 to 4.</p>
    <p>I've been a member of the church since I was 9, and served a mission a few years ago (... more than 20) in Italy.</p>
    <p>I like to build stuff, even though right now it's more fixing stuff. Let's say the kids keep me busy.</p>
    <p>During my former studies I leraned C and Java, but I never really used them. I work in the IT sector and I use Bash or Python for scripting, so I never really learned to crete a complex programming project.</p>
    <p>I'm currently pursuing a certificate in Web and Computer Programming.</p>
