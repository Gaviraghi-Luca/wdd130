                <h2>“IaaS”, “SaaS” or “PaaS”? and why “aaS”?</h2>
                <p>Just think about what you need to accomplish a project as simple as a public Website on your own.
                    First
                    you need to have a web server that can provide your web page to those who want to access it; to do
                    this you
                    must have a computer that is always connected to the Internet. This means you have to buy a
                    computer, pay for
                    electricity, have an internet connection with a fixed public IP address, so you have to pay for it.
                    And
                    if you want your website to run 24/7, you also have to take maintenance into account.</p>
                <p>Now, what happens if you start getting a lot of visits and need more power from your computer and
                    more
                    speed
                    from your Internet line? In other words, how can you scale your infrastructure to meet the required
                    performance?
                    This is what all those who wanted to approach the Web as actors, whether individuals or small or
                    large
                    companies had to face.</p>
                <p>The cloud helps to start providing a service without incurring startup costs that were affecting
                    development
                    resources. In cloud computing, the cloud service provider owns, manages and maintains the resources
                    (computational, storage, Internet access); the customer consumes them through an Internet connection
                    and
                    pays for them on a subscription or pay-as-you-go basis.
                    Thus, cloud solutions "as a service" offer primarily an economic benefit.
                    You can access and scale the IT resources you need at a predictable cost, without the expense and
                    overhead
                    of on-premise purchase and maintenance.</p>
                <p>Currently IaaS, PaaS and SaaS are the three most popular types of cloud service offerings. But what
                    do
                    these
                    acronyms mean?
                    IaaS, or infrastructure as a service, is on-demand access to cloud-hosted physical and virtual
                    servers,
                    storage and networking. You can set your own server in the cloud, for full control on your platform.
                    PaaS, or platform as a service, is on-demand access to a complete, ready-to-use, cloud-hosted
                    platform
                    for
                    developing, running, maintaining and managing applications. Never heard of Wordpress? You can use
                    such a
                    service to easily deploy web content.
                    SaaS, or software as a service, is on-demand access to ready-to-use, cloud-hosted application
                    software.
                    Think about your personal email. Do you own a mail server or have you subscribed to a web service,
                    such
                    as
                    gmail or hotmail?
                    Now you know what the main 'as a service' solutions of the cloud vendors are.</p>
