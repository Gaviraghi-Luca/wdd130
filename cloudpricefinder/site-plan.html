        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>I am going to create a website to choose cloud services of IaaS, PaaS or SaaS type at the most affordable
            price.
            In the cloud today, there are so many players with so many offerings. Looking for cloud service providers
            that meet your needs at the most affordable price can be a task of hours. My website helps save time and
            money by allowing you to get what you are looking for in minutes.
            The site requires you to enter a few parameters and features the best three rates from various Cloud
            providers; to stay up-to-date on rates you can sign up for the news-letter.</p> <!-- change this -->


        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>The intended audience is people who are not tied to a specific cloud platform. People that are looking for
            the best offerings to maintain their projects in the most economical way. Other possible audiences are those
            who
            want to use the site to check possible promotions and improve the effectiveness of their spending without
            having to change cloud platforms. Also people who are evaluating the costs of running their projects on
            different services offered: IaaS, PaaS or SaaS.</p> <!-- change this -->

        <p>“IaaS”, “SaaS” or “PaaS”? and why “aaS”?
            Just think about what you need to accomplish a project as simple as a public Website on your own. First you
            need to have a web server that can provide your web page to those who want to access it; to do this you must
            have a computer that is always connected to the Internet. This means you have to buy a computer, pay for
            electricity, have an internet connection with a fixed public IP address, so you have to pay for it. And if
            you want your website to run 24/7, you also have to take maintenance into account.
            Now, what happens if you start getting a lot of visits and need more power from your computer and more speed
            from your Internet line? In other words, how can you scale your infrastructure to meet the required
            performance?
            This is what all those who wanted to approach the Web as actors, whether individuals or small or large
            companies had to face.
            The cloud helps to start providing a service without incurring startup costs that were affecting development
            resources. In cloud computing, the cloud service provider owns, manages and maintains the resources
            (computational, storage, Internet access); the customer consumes them through an Internet connection and
            pays for them on a subscription or pay-as-you-go basis.
            Thus, cloud solutions "as a service" offer primarily an economic benefit.
            You can access and scale the IT resources you need at a predictable cost, without the expense and overhead
            of on-premise purchase and maintenance.
            Currently IaaS, PaaS and SaaS are the three most popular types of cloud service offerings. But what do these
            acronyms mean?
            IaaS, or infrastructure as a service, is on-demand access to cloud-hosted physical and virtual servers,
            storage and networking. You can set your own server in the cloud, for full control on your platform.
            PaaS, or platform as a service, is on-demand access to a complete, ready-to-use, cloud-hosted platform for
            developing, running, maintaining and managing applications. Never heard of Wordpress? You can use such a
            service to easily deploy web content.
            SaaS, or software as a service, is on-demand access to ready-to-use, cloud-hosted application software.
            Think about your personal email. Do you own a mail server or have you subscribed to a web service, such as
            gmail or hotmail?
            Now you know what the main 'as a service' solutions of the cloud vendors are.</p>
